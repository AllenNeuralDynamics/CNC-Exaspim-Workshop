# AIND - UW CNC ExaSPIM Workshop

Data and notebooks for the Hackacollabathon on December 6, 2023

Some ideas of things to explore:

•	Can we separate PT and IT cells in the cortex? What are the features that best separate them?

•	Compare projection patterns of neurons with soma in VM to those in VA/VL.

•	Cluster neurons based on projection patterns to parcellate nuclei in medulla and/or thalamus (see the Medulla notebook). Are dendritic morphological feature different between neurons with soma in the two main compartments of the medulla?

•	Can you build a decoder to predict soma location based on morphological features?

•	Are there morphological differences between neurons of different cell types? (this might be stymied by sampling issues - might not be enough neurons of different cell types yet)
